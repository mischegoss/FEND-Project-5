#### Restaurant Review Website

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** project phase one, I was asked to convert a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker.

### Provided Code and Dependencies

I was provided [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1) with a number of issues. My job was to fix the issues.

This project uses the following:

SAMPLE CHANGES TO SEE IF TRACKING!!!


* MapBox
* Leafletjs
* Normalize.css

In addition, I consulted the following resources:

* Grow With Google slack support
* Student [forum entry](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/p5-how-to-make-restaurant-attribute-strings-wrap-or-line-break-using-javascript/861307) on using breaks to improve readability  of restaurant hours
* Matthew Cranford's [Service Worker walkthrough](https://matthewcranford.com/restaurant-reviews-app-walkthrough-part-4-service-workers/)

### How to view project

First download or clone the respository to your local computer.

Then follow these instructions:

1. Start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000` to see the live site.
